Cypress tried to locate elements based on this query:\n\n> <a.button.checkout.wc-forward>\n\nWe initially found matching element(s), but while waiting for them to become actionable, they disappeared from the page. Common situations why this happens:\n  - Your JS framework re-rendered asynchronously\n  - Your app code reacted to an event firing and removed the element\n\nYou can typically solve this by breaking up a chain. For example, rewrite:\n\n> `cy.get('button').click().click()`\n\nto\n\n> `cy.get('button').as('btn').click()`\n> `cy.get('@btn').click()`\n\nhttps://on.cypress.io/element-has-detached-from-dom","children":[{"name":"Deve fazer um pedido na loja Ebac Shop de ponta a ponta","uid":"a847ea840d3451b1","parentUid":"c3e6d346a65518c73b67fa91efd952a8","status":"broken","time":{"start":1770727057478,"stop":1770727086704,"duration":29226},"flaky":false,"newFailed":false,"newPassed":false,"newBroken":false,"retriesCount":0,"retriesStatusChange":false,"parameters":[],"tags":[]}],"uid":"c3e6d346a65518c73b67fa91efd952a8"}],"uid":"bdbf199525818fae7a8651db9eafe741"}]}
